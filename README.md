# Jared's New Tab

It's a work in progress, but I'm happy with it so far.

TODOS:

- [x] Add a header that says good morning, good afternoon, etc. to myself

- [x] Add a large clock that displays the time (HH:MM:SS)

- [x] Add a smaller clock that displays the date (Monday, January 1)

- [ ] Add a two row, three column grid of common links
  - [ ] Email
  - [ ] Github
  - [ ] Treez
  - [ ] Youtube
  - [ ] Reddit
